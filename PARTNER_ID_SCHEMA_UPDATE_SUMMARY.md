# Partner ID Schema Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive update to add `partner_id` columns with foreign key constraints to all relevant tables in the CSuite database.

## Tables Updated

### Tables That Already Had partner_id with Foreign Key Constraints
âœ… **students** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **courses** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **subjects** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **topics** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **questions** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **question_sets** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **exams** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **batches** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **question_types** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  
âœ… **question_history** - Already had partner_id with proper foreign key constraint  

### Tables That Were Missing partner_id (Now Added)
ðŸ†• **student_exam_results** - Added partner_id column with foreign key constraint  
ðŸ†• **typing_passages** - Added partner_id column with foreign key constraint  
ðŸ†• **question_set_question** - Added partner_id column with foreign key constraint  

## System Tables (Correctly Excluded)
The following system tables were correctly excluded from having partner_id columns:
- users
- partners  
- roles
- cache
- jobs
- password_reset_tokens
- sessions

## Foreign Key Constraints
All partner_id columns now have proper foreign key constraints:
- **Referenced Table**: `partners`
- **Referenced Column**: `id`
- **Delete Action**: `CASCADE`
- **Constraint Naming**: `fk_{table_name}_partner_id`

## Indexes Added
Performance indexes were added for all partner_id columns:
- **Index Naming**: `idx_{table_name}_partner_id`
- **Purpose**: Improve query performance on partner_id lookups

## Data Population
For tables that had existing data, all records were populated with a default partner_id from the first available partner in the system.

## Migration Files
The following migration files were already in place and handled most of the partner_id additions:
- `2025_08_25_184913_add_partner_id_to_courses_table.php`
- `2025_08_25_185339_add_partner_id_to_subjects_table.php`
- `2025_08_25_185341_add_partner_id_to_topics_table.php`
- `2025_08_25_185610_add_partner_id_to_students_table.php`
- `2025_08_25_193322_add_partner_id_to_question_types_table.php`
- `2025_08_14_020726_add_partner_id_and_private_exam_name_to_question_history_table.php`

## Script Used
The `check_schema.php` script was used to:
1. Check all tables for missing partner_id columns
2. Add missing partner_id columns where needed
3. Add foreign key constraints where missing
4. Add performance indexes
5. Populate existing data with appropriate partner_id values

## Result
All relevant tables now have `partner_id` columns with proper foreign key constraints, ensuring data integrity and proper relationships between partners and their associated data.

## Verification
The schema was verified by running the check script multiple times, confirming that all tables now have the required partner_id columns with proper constraints.
