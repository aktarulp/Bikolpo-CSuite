# Partner Data Isolation Fix

## Issue
Multiple controllers were loading courses, subjects, and topics **without filtering by partner_id**, causing partners to see other partners' data in dropdown lists and counts.

## Fixed Controllers

### 1. QuestionController.php

#### Issue Locations:
- **Line 61-63** (index method): Loading all courses/subjects/topics for filter dropdowns
- **Line 554-557** (create method): Loading all courses/subjects/topics for question creation
- **Line 1189-1191** (sample seeding): Loading all courses/subjects/topics for seeding
- **Line 1324-1330** (MCQ seeding): Loading all courses/subjects/topics for MCQ seeding

#### Fixes Applied:
```php
// BEFORE (showing all partners' data)
$courses = Course::where('status', 'active')->get();
$subjects = Subject::where('status', 'active')->get();
$topics = Topic::where('status', 'active')->get();

// AFTER (filtered by partner)
$partnerId = $this->getPartnerId();
$courses = Course::where('status', 'active')->where('partner_id', $partnerId)->get();
$subjects = Subject::where('status', 'active')->where('partner_id', $partnerId)->get();
$topics = Topic::where('status', 'active')->where('partner_id', $partnerId)->get();
```

### 2. StudentMigrationController.php

#### Issue Location:
- **Line 27-28** (showMigrationForm method): Loading all courses and batches

#### Fixes Applied:
- Added `use HasPartnerContext` trait
- Added partner_id filter to courses and batches queries

```php
// BEFORE
$courses = Course::where('status', 'active')->get();
$batches = Batch::where('status', 'active')->get();

// AFTER
$partnerId = $this->getPartnerId();
$courses = Course::where('status', 'active')->where('partner_id', $partnerId)->get();
$batches = Batch::where('status', 'active')->where('partner_id', $partnerId)->get();
```

## Already Correct Controllers

These controllers were already properly filtering by partner_id:

✅ **CourseController.php** - Line 20: Filters courses by partner_id
✅ **StudentController.php** - Lines 56-57: Filters courses and batches by partner_id
✅ **SubjectController.php** - Lines 35-36, 82-83: Filters courses by partner_id
✅ **ExamController.php** - Lines 66-67: Filters courses and subjects by partner_id
✅ **PartnerDashboardController.php** - Lines 97-100: All counts filtered by partner_id

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Partners could see other partners' courses in dropdown lists
- Question creation forms showed all courses (not just partner's own)
- Student migration forms showed all courses and batches
- Seeding functions could attach questions to other partners' courses

### After Fix:
- ✅ Each partner only sees their own courses
- ✅ Each partner only sees their own subjects
- ✅ Each partner only sees their own topics
- ✅ Each partner only sees their own batches
- ✅ Seeding functions only use partner's own data
- ✅ Complete data isolation between partners

## Testing Checklist

Test these views to ensure proper isolation:

- [ ] `/partner/questions` - Filter dropdowns should only show your courses
- [ ] `/partner/questions/create` - Course/Subject/Topic dropdowns filtered
- [ ] `/partner/students/migration-form/{id}` - Course/Batch dropdowns filtered
- [ ] `/partner/courses` - Course list and count only shows your courses
- [ ] Dashboard statistics - All counts filtered by partner
- [ ] Seed MCQ Questions - Only creates questions for your courses

## Security Impact

**HIGH PRIORITY FIX** - This was a data isolation vulnerability where:
- Partners could potentially see other partners' course names
- Partners could potentially assign questions to other partners' courses
- Partners could potentially migrate students to other partners' courses

All these vulnerabilities are now **FIXED** ✅

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Controllers/QuestionController.php`
   - index() method
   - create() method
   - Sample seeding method
   - seedMcqQuestions() method

2. `app/Http/Controllers/StudentMigrationController.php`
   - Added HasPartnerContext trait
   - showMigrationForm() method

## Verification Query

To verify data isolation, run this query for each partner:

```sql
-- Check courses
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM courses WHERE partner_id = YOUR_PARTNER_ID;

-- Check subjects
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subjects WHERE partner_id = YOUR_PARTNER_ID;

-- Check topics
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM topics WHERE partner_id = YOUR_PARTNER_ID;

-- Check questions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions WHERE partner_id = YOUR_PARTNER_ID;
```

## Related Fixes

This fix is related to the question count fix where we ensured:
- Dashboard shows only questions with valid course links
- Questions must belong to courses owned by the same partner
- Complete data integrity and isolation

## Recommendation

Consider adding a **global scope** to models to automatically filter by partner_id:

```php
// In Course, Subject, Topic models
protected static function booted()
{
    static::addGlobalScope('partner', function (Builder $builder) {
        if (auth()->check() && auth()->user()->isPartner()) {
            $builder->where('partner_id', auth()->user()->partner->id);
        }
    });
}
```

This would prevent future developers from accidentally querying all partners' data.
