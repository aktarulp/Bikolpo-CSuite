### âœ… 2. AuthenticatedSessionController  
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`

- **Line 87**: Changed default user type from 'operator' to 'teacher'
- **Impact**: Non-teacher/student roles default to teacher type

## Files That Still Need Manual Cleanup (Optional)

### Low Priority - Can Delete:
1. `app/Http/Controllers/OperatorDashboardController.php` - Entire file
2. `resources/views/operator/dashboard.blade.php` - Entire file
3. `resources/views/layouts/operator-layout.blade.php` - Entire file

### Low Priority - Update Comments:
4. `app/Models/User.php` - Remove `isOperatorRole()` method (lines 191-199)
5. `app/Models/Role.php` - Update comment (line 158)
6. `config/permissions.php` - Remove Operator section (lines 216-220)
7. `app/Console/Commands/AssignRolesToUsers.php` - Remove operator mapping (lines 120-121)

## Database Cleanup (Recommended)

```sql
-- Check if any users still have operator role
SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users WHERE role = 'operator';

-- If you want to reassign them to another role:
UPDATE users SET role = 'partner', role_id = 3 WHERE role = 'operator';

-- Or delete the operator role from database
DELETE FROM role_permissions WHERE enhanced_role_id = (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'operator');
DELETE FROM user_roles WHERE role_id = (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'operator');
DELETE FROM roles WHERE name = 'operator';
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] User creation form only allows teacher/student types
- [x] Login with different roles works (partner, teacher, student)
- [x] No 500 errors when accessing protected routes
- [x] Operator users (if any) redirect to partner dashboard
- [x] Role dropdown doesn't show operator role

## System Status

### âœ… Critical Fixes Applied:
- User creation validation updated
- Login redirects updated
- Middleware updated
- View defaults updated

### ðŸ“‹ Optional Cleanup Remaining:
- Delete operator controller
- Delete operator views
- Remove operator from models
- Remove operator from config

## Impact Summary

**Before**: System supported operator role with dedicated dashboard and permissions

**After**: 
- Operator role removed from active use
- Existing operator users redirect to partner dashboard
- New users can only be created as teacher or student
- System continues to function normally for all other roles

## Status: âœ… OPERATOR ROLE SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED

The system no longer uses the operator role. All critical code has been updated to handle the removal gracefully. Optional cleanup can be done at your convenience.
