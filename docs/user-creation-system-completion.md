- `validateCurrentForm()`: Comprehensive client-side validation
- `submitForm()`: AJAX form submission with error handling

### 5. Enhanced Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/UserManagementController.php`)
**Key Methods:**
- `create()`: Displays the form with filtered roles and existing teachers/students
- `store()`: Comprehensive user creation with teacher/student profile creation

**Features:**
- **Dynamic Validation**: Different validation rules based on user type

## Database Integration

### User Creation Flow:
1. **Main User Record**: Created in `users` table with basic information
2. **Teacher/Student Record**: Created in respective tables with comprehensive data
3. **Role Assignment**: User linked to selected role via `user_roles` pivot table
4. **Default Role**: Teacher/Student records get default_role field populated
5. **Activity Logging**: Creation activity recorded for audit trail

### Auto-Generated IDs:
- **Teachers**: `TCH-2025-001`, `TCH-2025-002`, etc.
- **Students**: `STU-2025-001`, `STU-2025-002`, etc.

## Routes Configuration
All routes are properly configured in `routes/web.php`:
- `GET partner/settings/users/create` → `UserManagementController@create`
- `POST partner/settings/users` → `UserManagementController@store`
- Additional routes for user management, activities, and statistics

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Form Display
- **Operator**: Shows only basic user information
- **Teacher**: Shows teacher-specific form with comprehensive fields
- **Student**: Shows student-specific form with comprehensive fields

### 2. Auto-Population
- Teacher name (English) → Main form name field
- Teacher mobile → Main form phone field
- Student name → Main form name field

### 3. Validation
- **Client-side**: Real-time validation with visual feedback
- **Server-side**: Comprehensive validation rules based on user type
- **Required Fields**: Clearly marked with red asterisks

### 4. Error Handling
- **Field-specific errors**: Individual field validation messages
- **Form-level errors**: General form submission errors
- **AJAX errors**: Network and server error handling
- **Visual feedback**: Red borders and error messages for invalid fields

### 5. User Experience
- **Smooth animations**: Form transitions and loading states
- **Professional design**: Modern UI with proper spacing and colors
- **Mobile responsive**: Works well on all device sizes
- **Clear feedback**: Success/error notifications

## Usage Instructions

### For Operators:
1. Select "Operator" user type
2. Fill in basic user information (name, email, phone, password)

- **Activity logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Error logging**: Detailed error logging for debugging

## Testing Recommendations
1. **User Type Switching**: Test form visibility changes
2. **Auto-population**: Verify field synchronization works
3. **Validation**: Test both client and server-side validation
4. **Error Handling**: Test various error scenarios
5. **Database Creation**: Verify all records are created correctly
6. **Role Assignment**: Confirm roles are properly assigned

## Future Enhancements
