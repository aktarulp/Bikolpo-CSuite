| `option_d` | Yes | Fourth multiple choice option | "Madrid" |
| `correct_answer` | Yes | The correct answer (a, b, c, or d) | "b" |

**Optional Column:**
| Column | Required | Description | Example |

| `explanation` | No | Explanation of the answer | "Paris is the capital of France" |

### 3. Download Template

Click the **"Download CSV Template"** button to get a sample CSV file with the correct format and example data.

### 4. Upload Your File

1. Click **"Upload a file"** or drag and drop your CSV file
2. Ensure the file is in CSV format and under 2MB
3. Click **"Upload Questions as Drafts"** to process the file

### 5. Review & Publish Drafts

After upload, you'll be redirected to the **Drafts page** where you can:

1. **Review Questions**: See all uploaded questions in a table format
2. **Assign Metadata**: Use dropdowns to select course, subject, and topic
3. **Set Properties**: Adjust marks and difficulty level
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple questions for batch processing
5. **Publish**: Convert drafts to active questions

## File Requirements

- **Format**: CSV (Comma Separated Values) or TXT
- **Size**: Maximum 2MB
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 recommended
- **Headers**: Must include the 6 required column names exactly as shown above

## CSV Template Example

```csv
question_text,option_a,option_b,option_c,option_d,correct_answer,explanation
"What is the capital of France?","London","Paris","Berlin","Madrid","b","Paris is the capital and largest city of France."
"What is 2 + 2?","3","4","5","6","b","Basic addition: 2 + 2 = 4"
"Which planet is closest to the Sun?","Venus","Mercury","Earth","Mars","b","Mercury is the first planet from the Sun."
```

## Validation Rules

The system validates:
- **Required fields**: All 6 mandatory columns must be present
- **Correct answer format**: Must be 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' (case insensitive)
- **Data integrity**: Question text and options cannot be empty

## Error Handling

Common errors and solutions:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Missing required headers" | CSV doesn't have all 6 required columns | Use the template and ensure all columns are present |
| "Correct answer must be 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd'" | Invalid correct answer format | Use only single letters a, b, c, or d |
| "Error processing file" | File format or encoding issue | Ensure file is valid CSV with UTF-8 encoding |

## Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Begin with 5-10 questions to test the process
2. **Use the template**: Download and modify the provided template
3. **Check formatting**: Ensure correct answer uses single letters (a, b, c, d)
4. **Review drafts**: Always review questions before publishing
5. **Batch operations**: Use bulk selection for efficiency
